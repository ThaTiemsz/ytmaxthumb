Larger YouTube Thumbnail is a simple extension for Google Chrome that adds a right-click for the direct link to the maximum resolution of a YouTube video thumbnail. Only tested on Windows 10, should work with the latest Google Chrome version.

How to install:
- Download the ytmaxthumb.zip file under the releases" tab on GitHub
- Extract this somewhere on your computer
- Open Google Chrome
- Click on the three stripes on the right to bring up the menu
- Go over to More Tools and click on Extensions
- Turn Developer mode on
- Click the Load unpacked extension button and select the /1.1_0/ folder where you extracted the files to earlier
- Tick Enable if it isn't already
(You can disable Developer mode now, if you want to)
- Go to the YouTube site
- Right click on any thumbnail (not a video player) and click Open larger thumbnail in new tab

Enjoy.
